Bezerk was the first game\nto incorporate digital voice.  According to <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297022/trivia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IMDB</a>,\nit cost $1000 per word to digitise and compress the audio data.  Staying true to the robot taunts\nin Bezerk, Botwarz also incoporates robot digital audio but with the difference of applying the\nsame audio effects used for the voices of the cylons in battlestar galactica.  An in depth\nvideo series that goes over the details of how the cylon voices were created provides\nbackground on the digitization approach.  The use of a vocoder was key in creating the cylon voice,\nand vocoders have been used in 1980s doctor who theme creation and in a number of songs such as\n'let groove tonight' by Earth, Wind and Fire.  </p>\n<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 570; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: 40px;\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2EdTAHPcqg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>But how to create the voices segments in the first place? there are several online text-to-speech services that help in\ngenerating and customizing voice audio (male, female, american, english, deep or high voice etc).  The audio editing suite Audacity then provides\nthe required components for appying the appropriate sound effects to voice - synthesizer tones and a vocoder plugin.  But to\nget the exact effect settings requires lots of experimentation.  You can see (or rather hear) for yourself by\nplaying <a href=\"/playables/botwarz/\" target=\"_blank\">Botwarz</a>.
